# implementing-ssl-tls-go

This repo contains my attempt at working through Joshua Davies' book ["Implementing SSL/TLS with Cryptography and PKI"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Implementing-SSL-TLS-Using-Cryptography-ebook/dp/B004IK9TVO) but using Go and not C (as per the examples in the book).

I am using git tags to reference my progress through the chapters of the book.

**NOTE: The Go code found in this repo intentionally mirrors the C code from the book. I can see as I am writing the equivalant Go code that there are probably better ways of working with bytes and buffers that use existing interfaces and with the standard Go libraries.**
